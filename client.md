# Globus Connect Personal

**Globus Connect Personal** is the name of the software used to create Globus
Connect Personal endpoints, for sharing files with other users.  It is meant to
be installed on machines that Stanford classifies as _endpoints_,
machines that are used primarily by one person (such as desktops and laptops).

will work even behind a firewall (or home router), as long as you can make
outbound connections to certain ports on the outside Internet.
