Globus provides cloud-based services for reliably moving, sharing, publishing
and discovering data -- with Globus, users get unified access to all their data
via a single interface. Whether your files live on a supercomputer, lab
cluster, tape archive, public cloud, or your own laptop, you can manage this
data from anywhere, using your existing identities, via just a web browser.

Globus (www.globus.org) is a research data management service developed by the
University of Chicago and is used by hundreds of thousands of researchers at
institutions in the US and abroad. The Globus team is presenting a series of
workshops across the US, targeted at system administrators who have deployed
(or are planning to deploy) Globus at their institution, developers building
applications for research, and anyone who is interested in learning more about
the de-facto service for research data management. More details are available

We invite you to attend the workshop being held at Stanford University on
February 8-9, 2018. The workshop is free to attend but you must register as
