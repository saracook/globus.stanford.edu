# Amazon S3

Amazon S3 buckets—in all regions—may be accessed through the [SRCC SCG AWS
S3](https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/6122aa2f-bd3f-4474-b8bf-691c35397822/overview)
collection.

Before continuing, you will need to do some one-time setup work.  You will need
to…

* <a href="#service-limitations">Review the service limitations</a>, to see if
  they will affect your usage.  If you are still OK using Globus, your next
  step will be to…

* <a href="#creating-an-iam-user">Create an IAM User</a>, with an access key
  (officially an "Access Key ID") and a secret key (officially a "Secret Access
  Key").  *Each person may only have one IAM User associated with Globus.*
  Once your IAM User is created, you will need to…

* <a href="#assigning-local-permissions">Grant the IAM User access to
  buckets</a>.  For S3 buckets in other accounts, this will also give your IAM
  User permission to reach out to those other accounts.  Finally, you need to…

* <a href="#loading-credentials-into-globus">Load the IAM User credentials into
  Globus</a>.  This gives Globus access to S3, with the credentials you
  provide.

If you will be accessing S3 buckets in other accounts, those account owners
will also need to <a href="#assigning-cross-account-permissions">grant access
to your IAM User</a>.

Each step is described in detail below.

## Service Limitations

Globus has a number of limitations when working with Amazon S3.  These limits
do not affect most common use cases, but they might affect you, so you should
review them before starting to use Globus with Amazon S3.

Globus for Amazon S3 does not support the following S3 features:

* Custom Metadata / Tags: Custom Metadata and tags on existing objects are
  ignored when those objects are downloaded, and new objects do not have custom
  metadata or tags set.

* Versions: When downloading a file from an S3 bucket, Globus will always
  access the latest version.

* ACLs: ACLs on existing objects (and the bucket) will influence what you can
  download through Globus, but those ACLs are not copied out of S3.  When
  uploading new objects, ACLs are not explicitly set, and so inherit any
  bucket-level ACL that is set.

* Additional Checksum Algorithms: At this time, if an object in S3 needs to be
  verified, Globus will re-download it in order to compute the checksum.

* Requester-Pays buckets: Attempts to access a requester-pays bucket will
  always show a _Permission Denied_ error (that is what Amazon S3 returns).

* Storage classes that are not S3 Standard: Globus will always upload objects
  as Standard S3.  Globus can download objects that are stored with any storage
  class, with one exception: Objects stored in Glacier must be retrieved before
  they may be downloaded.

These limitations are present for two reasons:

1. Globus supports only a common set of features between storage platforms, to
   make file transfers as portable as possible.

2. The Globus-for-S3 add-on supports other platforms which speak S3.  Not all
   S3-speaking products support Amazon S3 features.

That being said, Globus has agreed to support Requester-Pays buckets as future
enhancement to the Globus-for-S3 add-on.  When that is available, an
announcement will be posted.

For users who want to upload data into a different storage class (that is not
S3 Standard), we suggest using [AWS Lambda with Amazon
S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3.html), so that as soon
as an object is uploaded to a bucket, the Lambda function triggers and sets the
correct storage class.

If you are OK with the limitations above, you should move on to creating an IAM
User, which Globus will need to interact with S3.

## IAM User Configuration

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 IAM Diagram.svg"
   alt="A diagram showing three AWS accounts.  The first account has an IAM
   User for Leland Stanford, and buckets for Leland Stanford and Leland
   Stanford Junior.  Leland Stanford has access to his bucket.  Leland Stanford
   also has access to one bucket in the other two AWS accounts."
   caption-header="An example IAM User with local and cross-account access"
   caption-text="The IAM User for Leland Stanford Senior has access to one bucket in his AWS account, plus buckets in the AWS accounts for the Central Pacific Railroad and Stanford University."
%}

Globus for S3 requires an IAM User to interact with Amazon S3.  Globus only
allows each person to add one IAM User, so if you need to access buckets in
other accounts, you will be configuring *cross-account access*.  This section
will explain how to set up your IAM User for access to local buckets and for
cross-account access.

This section assumes the fictitious environment above:

* AWS Account 123456789 has two buckets, one for Leland Stanford Senior and
  one for Leland Stanford Junior.

* AWS Account 312665112 has a bucket containing files related to the [Central
  Pacific Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Pacific_Railroad).

* AWS Account 650121554 has a bucket containing files related to the
  newly-founded [Leland Stanford Junior University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University#History).

* In AWS Account 123456789, an IAM User for Leland Senior—meant specifically
  for Globus use—has access to his own bucket in the local AWS account, as well
  as the buckets in the Railroad and University AWS accounts.

{% include info-box.html
   icon="arrow-alt-circle-up"
   header="Use a dedicated IAM User"
   content="It is best if you use a dedicated IAM User for Globus use, to keep Globus credentials separate from credentials in use on other platforms."
%}

### Creating an IAM User

Before granting access, you must first create an IAM User.  Within the AWS
Console, navigate to the *IAM* section, and click on *Users*.  Then click on
the "Add users" button.

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 IAM Dashboard.png"
   alt="The AWS IAM Dashboard, the contents of which are currently unimportant."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

Give your user a name, and select the "Access key - Programmatic access" box.
Click "Next: Permissions".

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 Add User screen 1.png"
   alt="A screen asking you to enter a username, and select how the IAM User will access AWS, either programmatically or via the web site."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

For now, we are not setting any permissions.  Click "Next: Tags".

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 Add User screen 2.png"
   alt="A screen asking you to assign permissions.  Right now no permissions are set."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

It is helpful to set a tag indicating who is using this IAM User.  Set a tag
with key "user" and a value of your SUNetID.  Click "Next: Review" and then
"Create user".

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 Add User screen 3.png"
   alt="A screen asking you to assign tags, with each tag having a key and optional value."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

AWS creates the user and creates a new Access key.  Copy the Access key ID and
Secret access key.

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 Add User final.png"
   alt="The screen confirming the creation of a new IAM User, with access key and secret key."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

**WARNING:** The Secret access key is **very sensitive**.  Keep it in a safe place,
and delete your local copy as soon as you have entered it into the Globus web
site.

You have now created an IAM User!  You can now proceed to give it permissions.

### Assigning Local Permissions

Now your IAM User is created, you need to grant it permission to access
buckets.  In addition to local buckets (which live in the same AWS account as
your IAM User), *you must also grant access to buckets in other AWS accounts.*

Within the AWS Console, navigate to the *IAM* section, and click on *Users*.

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 IAM Dashboard.png"
   alt="The AWS IAM Dashboard, the contents of which are currently unimportant."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

Locate your IAM User and click on its name.

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 IAM Users list with Leland Senior.png"
   alt="A screen showing a list of IAM users, showing Leland Senior's IAM User."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="A list of IAM Users, with Leland Senior"
   caption-text=""
%}

On the page which appears, click on "Add inline policy".

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 User Leland with no permissions.png"
   alt="A screen showing Leland Senior's IAM User, which has no permissions."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="Leland Senior, with no permissions (yet)"
   caption-text=""
%}

The *Visual Editor* will open.

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 User Visual Editor.png"
   alt="The IAM Visual Editor's starting screen, showing one empty permission, which has four parts."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="S3 Policy Visual Editor"
   caption-text=""
%}

The Visual Editor supports granting multiple permissions in a single policy.
The red boxes show where you can define a single permission and add additional
permissions.  Each permission has four parts:

1. The service which it applies to.

2. The specific actions that are allowed.

3. The resources where the permission applies.

4. Optional conditions which must be met in order for the permission to be 

You need to define three permissions.  All three permissions will be for the
"S3" service, and no optional conditions will be applied.

#### Global Permissions

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 User Permissions Bucket.png"
   alt="A Visual Editor permission allowing two actions, without limits."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="S3 global permissions required for Globus"
   caption-text=""
%}

First, you need to allow the `ListMyBuckets` and `GetBucketLocation`
actions, on all resources.  Globus uses the `ListMyBuckets` permission to
populate a list of buckets available in the local AWS account; it uses the
`GetBucketLocation` permission to identify the AWS region for a bucket.

#### Bucket-level Permissions

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 User Permissions List.png"
   alt="A Visual Editor permission allowing two List actions, on specific buckets."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="S3 bucket permissions required for Globus"
   caption-text=""
%}

Next, you need to allow the `ListBucket` and `ListBucketMultipartUploads`
actions.  `ListBucket` allows Globus to get a list of object in a bucket.
`ListBucketMultipartUploads` is used by Globus when uploading objects to a
bucket.

You should limit this permission to only the specific buckets that
need to be accessed through Globus.  Amazon identifies resources by 'ARN'.  The
ARN format for an S3 bucket is `arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME`.  You need to include
the ARN of every bucket that Globus will be allowed to access.

#### Object-level Permissions

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 User Permissions Transfer.png"
   alt="A Visual Editor permissions allowing several upload, download, and deletion actions, on all objects in specific buckets."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="S3 object permissions required for Globus"
   caption-text=""
%}

Finally, you need to allow all of the permissions needed for uploading,
downloading, and deleting:

* To allow downloading files from S3, you need to allow the `GetObject` action.

* To allow uploading files to S3, you need to allow the `PutObject`,
  `ListMultipartUploadParts`, and `AbortMultipartUpload` actions.

* To allow deleting files from S3, you need to allow the `DeleteObject` action.

You should limit this permission to all of the objects in the specific buckets
that need to be accessed through Globus.  The ARN format for S3 objects is
`arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*`.  You need to include the ARN of every bucket that
Globus will be allowed to access.  You can limit the permission to specific
objects or prefixes, but this is not recommended except in advanced use cases.

#### Local Permissions Summary

In the end, you should have three permissions, matching the pictures above.
If you look at the policy in the JSON editor, it should look similar to this:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllBuckets",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Bucket",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::leland_sr_files",
                "arn:aws:s3:::cp_rr_files",
                "arn:aws:s3:::su_board_files"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Objects",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::leland_sr_files/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::cp_rr_files/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::su_board_files/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Review the policy, give it a name, and save.  The policy will take effect
within a minute or two of it being saved.

As your access changes in the future, you should edit the `Resource` sections,
adding and removing buckets as needed.  *Remember to modify **both** Resource
sections that have bucket names!*

Now that your local access has been set, the owners of the other AWS accounts
need to grant you access to their buckets.
