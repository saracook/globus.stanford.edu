# Amazon S3

Amazon S3 buckets—in all regions—may be accessed through the [SRCC SCG AWS
S3](https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/6122aa2f-bd3f-4474-b8bf-691c35397822/overview)
collection.

Before continuing, you will need to do some one-time setup work.  You will need
to…

* <a href="#service-limitations">Review the service limitations</a>, to see if
  they will affect your usage.  If you are still OK using Globus, your next
  step will be to…

* <a href="#creating-an-iam-user">Create an IAM User</a>, with an access key
  (officially an "Access Key ID") and a secret key (officially a "Secret Access
  Key").  *Each person may only have one IAM User associated with Globus.*
  Once your IAM User is created, you will need to…

* <a href="#assigning-local-permissions">Grant the IAM User access to local
  buckets</a> (that is, buckets within the same AWS account).  You also need to
  give your IAM User permission to reach out to other AWS accounts.  Finally,
  you need to…

* <a href="#loading-credentials-into-globus">Load the IAM User credentials into
  Globus</a>.  This gives Globus access to S3, with the credentials you
  provide.

If you will be accessing S3 buckets in other accounts, those account owners
will also need to <a href="#assigning-cross-account-permissions">grant access
to your IAM User</a>.

Each step is described in detail below.

## Service Limitations

Globus has a number of limitations when working with Amazon S3.  These limits
do not affect most common use cases, but they might affect you, so you should
review them before starting to use Globus with Amazon S3.

Globus for Amazon S3 does not support the following S3 features:

* Custom Metadata / Tags: Custom Metadata and tags on existing objects are
  ignored when those objects are downloaded, and new objects do not have custom
  metadata or tags set.

* Versions: When downloading a file from an S3 bucket, Globus will always
  access the latest version.

* ACLs: ACLs on existing objects (and the bucket) will influence what you can
  download through Globus, but those ACLs are not copied out of S3.  When
  uploading new objects, ACLs are not explicitly set, and so inherit any
  bucket-level ACL that is set.

* Additional Checksum Algorithms: At this time, if an object in S3 needs to be
  verified, Globus will re-download it in order to compute the checksum.

* Requester-Pays buckets: Attempts to access a requester-pays bucket will
  always show a _Permission Denied_ error (that is what Amazon S3 returns).

* Storage classes that are not S3 Standard: Globus will always upload objects
  as Standard S3.  Globus can download objects that are stored with any storage
  class, with one exception: Objects stored in Glacier must be retrieved before
  they may be downloaded.

These limitations are present for two reasons:

1. Globus supports only a common set of features between storage platforms, to
   make file transfers as portable as possible.

2. The Globus-for-S3 add-on supports other platforms which speak S3.  Not all
   S3-speaking products support Amazon S3 features.

That being said, Globus has agreed to support Requester-Pays buckets as future
enhancement to the Globus-for-S3 add-on.  When that is available, an
announcement will be posted.

For users who want to upload data into a different storage class (that is not
S3 Standard), we suggest using [AWS Lambda with Amazon
S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3.html), so that as soon
as an object is uploaded to a bucket, the Lambda function triggers and sets the
correct storage class.

If you are OK with the limitations above, you should move on to creating an IAM
User, which Globus will need to interact with S3.

## IAM User Configuration

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 IAM Diagram.svg"
   alt="A diagram showing three AWS accounts.  The first account has an IAM
   User for Leland Stanford, and buckets for Leland Stanford and Leland
   Stanford Junior.  Leland Stanford has access to his bucket.  Leland Stanford
   also has access to one bucket in the other two AWS accounts."
   caption-header="An example IAM User with local and cross-account access"
   caption-text="The IAM User for Leland Stanford Senior has access to one bucket in his AWS account, plus buckets in the AWS accounts for the Central Pacific Railroad and Stanford University."
%}

Globus for S3 requires an IAM User to interact with Amazon S3.  Globus only
allows each person to add one IAM User, so if you need to access buckets in
other accounts, you will be configuring *cross-account access*.  This section
will explain how to set up your IAM User for access to local buckets and for
cross-account access.

This section assumes the fictitious environment above:

* AWS Account 123456789 has two buckets, one for Leland Stanford Senior and
  one for Leland Stanford Junior.

* AWS Account 312665112 has a bucket containing files related to the [Central
  Pacific Railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Pacific_Railroad).

* AWS Account 650121554 has a bucket containing files related to the
  newly-founded [Leland Stanford Junior University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University#History).

* In AWS Account 123456789, an IAM User for Leland Senior—meant specifically
  for Globus use—has access to his own bucket in the local AWS account, as well
  as the buckets in the Railroad and University AWS accounts.

   header="Use a dedicated IAM User"
   content="It is best if you use a dedicated IAM User for Globus use, to keep Globus credentials separate from credentials in use on other platforms."
%}

### Creating an IAM User

Before granting access, you must first create an IAM User.  Within the AWS
Console, navigate to the *IAM* section, and click on *Users*.  Then click on
the "Add users" button.

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 IAM Dashboard.png"
   alt="The AWS IAM Dashboard, the contents of which are currently unimportant."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

Give your user a name, and select the "Access key - Programmatic access" box.
Click "Next: Permissions".

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 Add User screen 1.png"
   alt="A screen asking you to enter a username, and select how the IAM User will access AWS, either programmatically or via the web site."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

For now, we are not setting any permissions.  Click "Next: Tags".

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 Add User screen 2.png"
   alt="A screen asking you to assign permissions.  Right now no permissions are set."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

It is helpful to set a tag indicating who is using this IAM User.  Set a tag
with key "user" and a value of your SUNetID.  Click "Next: Review" and then
"Create user".

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 Add User screen 3.png"
   alt="A screen asking you to assign tags, with each tag having a key and optional value."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

AWS creates the user and creates a new Access key.  Copy the Access key ID and
Secret access key.

{% include hero-image.html
   src="assets/cloud/S3 Add User final.png"
   alt="The screen confirming the creation of a new IAM User, with access key and secret key."
   caption-overlay=true
   caption-header="AWS IAM Dashboard"
   caption-text=""
%}

**WARNING:** The Secret access key is **very sensitive**.  Keep it in a safe place,
and delete your local copy as soon as you have entered it into the Globus web
site.

You have now created an IAM User!  You can now proceed to give it permissions.
