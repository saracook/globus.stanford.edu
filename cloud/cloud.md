# Google Cloud Storage

Google Cloud Storage may be accessed through the [Stanford Google Cloud
](https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/1a7d4931-986a-42f5-80fc-1fafe28f9826/overview)
collection.

Google Cloud is one of the easiest cloud services to access, but more
documentation will be forthcoming!
