owner:
  # The owner name must be provided.
  name: "Stanford Research Computing"

  # Next up is social media handles.  If you don't have one, use the word
  # "null", but without the quotes.

  # If you have a Facebook page, put your account name here.
  # Example, if your Facebook URL is https://facebook.com/xyz, put "xyz".

# If you would like to use the Google Search Console (also known as Google
# Webmaster Tools) with your site, you can provide your
# 'google-site-verification' code here.  See the instructions below:
#
# NOTE: Do not enable this until after your site is live at your preferred
# domain!
#
# 1) Go to https://google.com/webmasters/tools, signing in with your
#    Stanford Google account.
# 2) Choose "Add A Property", and paste in your web site's URL.
# 3) When asked for verification, go to the "Alternate methods tab" and
#    choose "HTML tag".
# 4) Examine the <meta> tag that Google wants you to add.  The tag's name
#    should be "google-site-verification".  Take the tag's content, and put
#    it here.
#
#    For example, if your tag says...
#       <meta name="google-site-verification" content="12545asbcdgre" />
#    ... then you would put in "12345asbcdgre" (_including_ the quotes).
# 5) Push your changes to GitHub, and wait a few minutes.
# 6) Go back to your web browser, and click the "Verify" button.
#    If Google can't verify your site, wait a few minutes and try again.

# For pages which live on GitHub, the _de rigeur_ thing to do is to provide
# users an opportunity to improve your site.  The idea is, if people see that
# something is wrong with the page, giving them the ability to fix it
# themselves may make them more likely to do it.
#
# If this option is set to a string, that string will appear in the
# bottom-right of every page, with a link to the source file on GitHub.  To
# disable this, change the setting to "null" (without the quotes).
#
# NOTE: When you are testing changes locally, the link URL will not be
# accurate.  It will only be correct when pages are being served from GitHub.

# The index.html page of the site defaults to being your site's "blog page".
# (Altough the example calls it "Announcements", it's kindof the same thing.)
# By default, the full list of posts are split into pages of three posts per
# page.  For each additional page, a complete copy of index.html will be
# created, but with a different list of posts.
#
# You can change the number to whatever you want.  If you want to disable
# pagination entirely (and so have all posts appear on the main page), comment
# out the line below.
